            p.step.step0
              | This website is intended to assist in building intuition about the
              | dynamics of two-player games. It provides visualizations for the
              | best-response dynamics, as well as for two population discrete-time
              | and continuous-time replicator dynamics.
            p.step.step0
              | This is a tutorial intended to show you what the system can do and
              | how to use it. Opening another browser window or tab and following
              | along is highly encouraged. Please see the&#32;
              a(href="#!/requirements") system requirements
              | &#32;page as well.

            h3.step.step1 Basic Controls and Adding Games
            p.step.step1
              | To begin, you are presented only with&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot1.png") some controls
              | . At the outset, we are most concerned with the "add game"
              | button. 
            p.step.step1
              | Clicking the "add game" button will reveal an&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot2.png") interface for entering game information
              | . The entry defaults to allowing you to enter all game parameters.
              | However, there is a&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot3.png") drop-down available
              | &#32;with which you can select to use one of many common games
              | instead of entering your own.
            p.step.step1
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot4.png") Selecting "Stag Hunt" from the drop-down
              | &#32;will enter values for the game parameters automatically. We
              | can also&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot5.png") give the game a label
              | &#32;to more easily remember what game it is later. Giving the game
              | a label is optional. If one is not provided, a (rather ugly) one
              | will be generated.
            p.step.step1
              | You can re-select drop-down entries and change the game parameters
              | as much as you would like. When you are satisfied with the parameter
              | values, clicking the "save game" button will save the parameters and&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot6.png") show you the normal (strategic) form of the game
              | .

            h3.step.step2 Generating Visualizations
            p.step.step2
              | Once we have the normal (strategic) form of the game, clicking the
              | "generate graphs" button will (perhaps a bit slowly)&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot7.png") reveal four graphs
              | . If the graphs are not generated, please check that your system
              | meets the &#32;
              a(href="#!/requirements") system requirements
              | .
            p.step.step2
              | The top-left graph shows the best-response dynamics for the game.
              | The axes in each graph correspond to the cells of the normal form.
              | For example, the top-left corner of the graph is the point where the
              | row player always chooses the upper row and the column player
              | chooses the left column.
            p.step.step2
              | The bottom-left graph shows a differential vector field according
              | to the replicator dynamics. The upper-right graph shows trajectories
              | of the discrete-time replicator dynamics, and the bottom-right graph
              | shows trajectories of the continuous-time replicator dynamics.

            h3.step.step3 Editing Games
            p.step.step3
              | At any time, you can go back and edit the game you have entered.
              | Clicking the "edit game" button will return you to
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot8.png") the game editing interface
              | . Changing the drop-down selector to "Free Entry" will&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot9.png") let us change the values of the game parameters
              | &#32;to anything we would like. For example, we might enter the
              | payoffs show in&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot9.png") this screenshot
              | .
            p.step.step3
              | When we are done editing the parameters, we can again click the
              | "save game" button and return to&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot11.png") viewing the normal form
              | &#32;of the game. Clicking "generate graphs" with these new parameters
              | will once again&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot12.png") reveal several graphs
              | &#32;visualizing the various aspects of the dynamical systems
              | mentioned earlier.
            p.step.step3

            h3.step.step4 Using Multiple Games at Once
            p.step.step4
              | Sometimes it is useful to compare games directly. While we could
              | look at one game's dynamics, edit the parameters, and then look at
              | another's, it is often easier to have both sets of graphs on the
              | screen at the same time. This system makes that relatively easy.
            p.step.step4
              | At any time, you can again click the "add game" button, which will&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot13.png") insert an entry form for another game
              | &#32;at the bottom of the page. This form works exactly like the
              | the first one we demonstrated earlier.
            p.step.step4
              | Having many games saved at the same time can be unwieldy. Therefore,
              | it is possible to "collapse" the games,&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot14.png") leaving only their label showing
              | .
              | This is accomplished either by clicking the "collapse all" button,
              | or by clicking on an individual game's label.
              | To re-expand the game, click on the label a second time, or click
              | the "expand all" button.
            p.step.step4
              | Finally, games can also be sorted in the list by dragging them up
              | and down. A blue area will&#32;
              a.lightbox(href="./images/Screenshot15.png") show where the game will be inserted
              | &#32;in the list once it is released.
